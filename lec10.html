            <h2><u>History</u></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>According to legend, Sukuna was an Imaginary Demon (仮か想そうの鬼き神じん Kasō no Kijin?) during the <b>Heian Era</b>. In truth, he was a human sorcerer also known as the <i><b>Disgraced One</b></i> (堕だ天てん Daten?).Jujutsu sorcerers of the Golden Age of Jujutsu gave their all against him but ultimately fell one after another. </li>
                <li> Sukuna existed throughout the ages by transforming into a cursed object after death, a state where he split his power into <b>twenty indestructible fingers</b></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Ancient past:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Single-handedly slaughtering both the Sun, Moon, and Stars Squad and the <b> Five Empty Generals </b>, the most elite of the <b> Fujiwara Clan's forces</b>, <br>
                    leaving the authorities of Japan so utterly terrified that they were willing to hold festivities in his honor.</li>
                <li>
                    The impact Sukuna left on history until he died earned him the title of the "Strongest Sorcerer in History", as well as the <b> "King of Curses".</b>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Present:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>His strength is still held in such a high regard that even <b>Satoru Gojo</b>, the strongest jujutsu sorcerer of the modern age, <br>
                    with arrogance levels of confidence and pride in his abilities, acknowledged his strength and that a fight between the two of them would be difficult.</li>
                <li>In the <b>Shinjuku Showdown Arc</b>, Sukuna, having regained his full power, fought Satoru Gojo in a neck to neck battle of constant Domain Clashes,<br>
                     with Sukuna using <b>Mahoraga </b> to counter Gojo's powers. Seemingly defeated, Sukuna adapts to Gojo's Cursed Technique, and <b>kills</b> the sorcerer.</li>
